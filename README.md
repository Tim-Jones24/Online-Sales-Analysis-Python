#### Project Overview

In an increasingly digital world, online retailers generate vast amounts of transactional data daily. However, raw data is rarely clean, consistent, or ready for decision-making. This project uses **Python** and powerful data analysis libraries such as **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Scikit-learn** to extract meaningful insights from online sales transaction data.

Through careful **data cleaning**, **data enrichment**, **visual storytelling**, and **correlation analysis**, the project delivers high-impact insights relevant to business and product teams.
